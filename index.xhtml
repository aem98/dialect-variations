        <h1>Jordanian Arabic: Spoken Grammar Variations</h1>
        <h3>About the Project</h3>
        <p>The project focuses on patterns used in the Jordanian dialect of Arabic to analyze how speakers use varying grammer structures. 
            It examines authentic snippets of text from Jordanians, taken from the Facebook page called Humans of Amman, as its corpus. 
            The project mainly focuses on three grammar concepts: 
                <ol>
                    <li>The use of dialectical prefixes in verbs</li>
                    <li>Gender agreement among noun/adjective phrases</li> 
                    <li>Prepositions that link to the following words</li>
                </ol>
        </p>
