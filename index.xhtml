        <h1>Jordanian Arabic: Spoken Grammar Variations</h1>
        <h4>About the Project</h4>
        <p>The project focuses on patterns used in the Jordanian dialect of Arabic to analyze how speakers use varying grammer structures. 
            It examines authentic snippets of text from Jordanians, taken from the Facebook page called Humans of Amman, as its corpus. 
            The project mainly focuses on three grammar concepts: 
                <ol>
                    <li>The use of a certain preference in some verbs</li>
                    <li>Gender agreement</li> 
                    <li>Changes in adjective conjugation</li>
                </ol>
        </p>
