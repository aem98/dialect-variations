        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <h2>Corpus</h2>
        <p>
            The corpus for this research came from a public art project called Humans of Amman. 
            Humans of Amman captures photographs of people around Amman, Jordan and adds captions given by the subjects of the photographs.
            These captions are what were used in the research to analyze the language these Jordanians use.

        <h2>The Grammer Variations</h2>
        <p>The research project focuses on three main grammar variations; 
            gender agreement, verb prefixes, and elision in prepositions. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I looked at gender agreement among nouns and adjectives. 
            In Arabic, some nouns are feminine and others masculine, with most feminine nouns ending 
            in a specific letter marker. Nouns with this feminine marker or that are non-human and 
            plural must having any matching adjectives also contain the feminine letter marker. 
            I marked nouns and adjectives that agreed, whether masculine or feminine, 
            with a ‘y’ attribute and those that didn’t agree with a ‘n’.
            This gender agreement also exists very similarly in Modern Standard Arabic but 
            I choose to test it to see that if in dialect speakers would get lazy and at times forget to agree in gender.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            There is a letter ‘b’ prefix that is often put in front of verbs in dialectal Arabic. 
            However, the rules for when to put a ‘b’ prefix and when not to are not concrete in anyway. 
            There are general rules, such as not after another verb or auxiliary verb, 
            but the goal of marking all the present tense verbs was to see in what cases the prefix was 
            used and not and how this changed depending on where the verb was in the sentence,
            i.e. after a past tense verb, negated, after a participle, etc. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Elision refers to the omission of a sound of syllable when speaking. 
            In dialect, there’s a tendency to smash together some prepositions with their preceding nouns. 
            The point in marking these prepositions was too see when and when not elision took place 
            and how the presence of absence of a definite marker on the following noun affected this elision.
