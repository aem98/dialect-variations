        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <h2>Corpus</h2>
        <p>
            The corpus for this research came from a public art project called Humans of Amman. 
            Humans of Amman captures photographs of people around Amman, Jordan and adds captions given by the subjects of the photographs.
            These captions are what were used in the research to analyze the language these Jordanians use. 
            <br></br>

            Thanks to all the people behind the Humans of Amman project!
