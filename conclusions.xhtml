        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Gender</h2>
            <p> My hypothesis for gender held up as I imagined it would. The speakers made very few
                gender agreement mistakes and the few that we did look at were easily explained and
                understandable. </p>
            <p>From this study we can conclude that native Arabic speakers make few gender agreement
                errors. It’s a bit difficult to imagine since gender agreement doesn’t really exist
                in English but it makes sense in Arabic that speakers would obey the rules because
                it’s such an ingrained part of the language that it becomes natural to use gender
                agreement. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Prepositions</h2>
            <p>My original hypothesis for elision in regards to prepositions was that it would occur
                more often than not but the data concluded otherwise. I original thought more often
                would be the case because exhibiting elision is just a simpler and faster way to use
                the language that is still understood. There are a few explanations that could
                account for the findings. The first is that the way in which the interviews were
                conducted, the speakers may have been inclined to use a slightly more formal
                register where they felt it important to better enunciate. Secondly, these could
                also be errors in transcribing as each interview was transcribed by someone and they
                may have varied what was actually said for the sake of writing style and habit. And
                thirdly, perhaps, I was just wrong to assume speakers would default to an easier
                pronunciation and this was my own bias and personal preference.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Verbs</h2>
            <p>My hypothesis on verbs mostly held up as well, however due to the vast size and
                complicated nature of the data for verbs, it’s hard to categorize them all into one.
                My hypothesis for plain verbs was about what was to be expected with there being
                about a third of plain verbs using a prefix although I may have guessed this number
                to be a bit higher. </p>
            <p>For the rest of the verbs, I got about what I expected with a few unexpected
                variations. </p>
            <p>Overall, there was very few cases of the prefix being used in one the categories that
                came after a verb/tense marker. However for the marker 3m, which is a marker that
                turns the proceeding verb into an -ing verb, there was almost equal amounts prefixes
                as non prefixes. This wasn’t expected but it’s understandable as it’s a very unique
                sort of marker and the tendency to use it to create an -ing verb might not
                automatically detract from the emphasis the b prefix would put on the following
                verb. </p>
            <p>As for the rest, future and participle received absolutely no prefixes and negation
                received the most out of the rest. However, none of these numbers are out of the
                expected range. However, other than the plain verbs, the rest of the data for verbs
                was relatively low so it would be interesting to see how it would shift if we were
                to add more excerpts and reanalyze the data. </p>
